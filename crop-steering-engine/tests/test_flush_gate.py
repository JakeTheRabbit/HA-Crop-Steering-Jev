"""The EC flush gate: a table that drains, not a moisture reading under the field capacity setpoint.

5 Oct 2026, F2 zone 2: pore EC 7.1 against a P2 target of 4.5, feed 3.05, plants yellowing. Its probe reads 15 to
20 points high since the 29 Sep sump flood (70.7 % against a field capacity of 54), and every flush needed the
reading under field capacity - 2, so the zone got no flush at all that day: two P1 shots, then only the daily
minimum. The capped corrections now need dilutive feed and a table that drains; the cap-exempt flushes keep the
field capacity test, so a probe reading high cannot run them outside the daily budget.
