"""The zone's setpoints follow its own highest readings, and P1 ends when a shot no longer raises them.

The owner, 6 Oct 2026: "the P1 target should be the VWC MAX the previous days actual field capacity, the highest
value that the VWC got to during the day is the next days p1 target", "the FC needs to increase as the sensor
does", "the p2 dryback and shit needs to move as well to be in line with the new FC", "the rescue floor should
increase too", "get rid of this rule ... which may only rise 2 points a day", and "the transition from p1 to p2 is
determined by reaching the p1 target, giving an extra shot, if it doesnt rise more, transition to p2, if it rises
more, do another shot until it stops rising". So:
  - at lights-on the grow-day's peak (the highest VWC since the last lights-on) is kept as the day before's;
  - field capacity = the higher of today's peak and the day before's; the P1 target = the day before's, with no
    limit on how far it moves; the re-water threshold and the rescue floor move with field capacity;
  - the learner writes neither; the P1 rule (core.decide) is fed the latch, the peak before each P1 shot and the
    count of shots after the target.
Numbers: F2 zone 2 and zone 3 on 6 Oct 2026 (their 5 Oct peaks 71.48 and 73.4).
