"""CS-310: a zone's moisture rising while no water goes in is a table that isn't draining.

On 29 Sep 2026 F2 Zone 2 climbed from 37 % to 71 % in a day with one shot: its slabs were sitting in runoff from
a sump that had stopped. Nothing said so. The controller now watches every zone's reading against its valve: a
rise of BACKUP_RISE_PTS within BACKUP_WINDOW_MIN, with the valve shut for that time and the BACKUP_GRACE_MIN
before it, raises CS-310 (critical) and holds the zone's daily minimum, which waters whatever the probe reads and
would otherwise pour more into a flooded table.
