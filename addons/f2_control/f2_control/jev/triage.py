"""Which alerts are worth a phone push (the Alerts judge, docs/JEV.md).

The base controller pushes every alert to the phone like a critical fault, every 30 minutes while it
lasts, whatever the hour. Every alert still becomes a Home Assistant notification card; this decides
only the push. The first time an alert is raised it pushes as it always did, because nothing waits on
Jev; Jev's answer then decides whether its repeats keep buzzing a phone. Some alerts always push: a
pump or valve fault, a probe the controller has lost, water not reaching a zone, and anything Jev itself
raises about a probe.
