"""Crop-steering doctrine for Jev: the owner's GrowLabs wiki, restated as rules a judge can quote.

Jev answers typed questions about the facts it is given, but it knows no crop-steering doctrine and does no
arithmetic, so every judge writes the doctrine into its question. This module keeps that doctrine in one
place: Ben Isdale's GrowLabs wiki pages (SOURCES), each point restated as one plain sentence tagged with the
page it comes from. A judge appends doctrine("ramp", "probe") to a question's instructions.

True water content vs probe readings: the wiki's moisture numbers (a ~92 % full mark, a 55-92 % working band,
a 25-30 % recovery floor, drybacks of 5-30 points) are TRUE water content. A probe can read far from that: the
F2 probes read about 33-41 % at saturation. So no rule sets an absolute moisture band against a raw reading.
The rules judge a zone against its own saturation, its own peak and its own trends, and they say "true water
content" wherever they keep a wiki number.

Stage arc: the rockwool and one-steering-law pages put the deepest drybacks and the highest EC in flower
weeks 4-6. The slab-irrigation page (Athena and CCI) makes flower days 22-42 a vegetative bulk. On 26 Sep 2026
the owner chose the slab page's arc, so STAGE_ARC and the "stage" rules follow it. ALT_STAGE_ARC keeps the
other arc for reference only.

Within each topic the rules are listed most important first, so doctrine(..., limit=n) keeps the core.
