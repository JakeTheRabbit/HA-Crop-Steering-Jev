"""P0: has the morning dryback gone far enough to start the ramp?

The base engine starts the ramp (P1) when the dryback reaches its target, when moisture falls to the re-water
threshold, or when P0 has lasted its maximum wait. The dryback is measured from the highest reading since P0
began, and a reading lifted by free water (a shot shortly before, a P0 flush) drains away within minutes, so
the figure reads larger than the slab really dried. And the plants' morning uptake varies: some mornings they
are drinking within the hour, some mornings the slab barely moves until the timer ends P0. A grower looking at
the curve starts the ramp when the plants are drinking and the slab has dried back enough. So does this
judge. It can only bring the ramp forward: the base engine's own three ways out of P0 still happen.
