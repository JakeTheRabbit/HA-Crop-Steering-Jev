"""Every phase: is this zone's probe telling the truth?

A probe counts for the base engine if it gives an in-range number that changes. A probe pulled half out,
sitting in a channel, stuck on a value it keeps reporting, or wired to the wrong row passes all of that.
The test a person uses is the shots: water goes in, a working probe goes up and dries back down. This
judge reads each probe's answers to the shots against the zone's own typical rise and its siblings'.

Setting a probe aside needs three things: the council twice in a row, code's own confirmation (two
settled shots with almost no rise while a sibling rose, or a flat line for an hour with water going in),
and a fresh answer: when a later answer says the probe tracks, it counts again.
