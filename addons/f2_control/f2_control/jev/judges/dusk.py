"""P2: when does the day's watering stop?

The base engine starts the overnight dryback (P3) at lights-off, or earlier by prediction: in the last 3 hours,
only when the dryback still needed would not finish by lights-on at the zone's drying rate. That rate is the
fall over the last half hour, which is usually 0 when a shot sits in that half hour, and the engine then assumes
0.1 points an hour: at that pace anything over 1.2 points is more than the 12 hours the prediction looks
ahead, so it rarely fires and the zone is topped up until lights-off. Generative steering wants the opposite:
the last shot earlier, so the slab dries back overnight toward its target. A grower stops the watering when
the zone is well above its re-water threshold and far enough above the emergency floor to coast to lights-on.
So does this judge. It can only bring P3 forward, and the overnight rescue shot still fires whatever it says.
