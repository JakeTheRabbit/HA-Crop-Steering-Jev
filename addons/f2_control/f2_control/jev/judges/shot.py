"""Every phase: did the water land?

A shot the controller fired is not a shot the plants got. On 24 Sep 2026 F2 zone 2 did not land from 14:36
to 16:42: four shots of about 270 s, moisture falling 30.5 -> 26.4 while zones 1 and 3 landed normally.
The watchdog meant to catch it could never fire (it was gated on health sensors that no longer existed).
A person reads a shot the way this judge does: water went in; did the probe go up and stay up, did pore
EC move toward the feed, and what did the sibling zones watered at the same time do?

Each shot is audited once, about 20 minutes after it ends (the newest one, when shots come faster than
the cadence). The judge never adds water: its only directive is the CS-701 alert, raised when two shots
in a row did not reach the zone. Watering carries on as normal either way.
