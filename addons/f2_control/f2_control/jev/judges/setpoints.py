"""Tomorrow's maintenance watering, one notch at a time: the Setpoints judge (docs/JEV.md).

Asked once a grow-day, early in the night, when the day's water, shots and pore EC are complete. Jev chooses one
change to the zone's P2 maintenance watering for tomorrow, or none. Code turns the choice into one notch on one of
the zone's own numbers, inside a band around the operator's own value:

- the P2 shot size, 0.5 % a notch, at most 1 % either side of the operator's value and never under 3 %;
- the P2 re-water threshold, 0.5 points a notch, from 2 points under to 1 point over the operator's value, always
  4 points above the rescue floor and 2 under the ramp's ceiling.

Why this shape (26 Sep 2026): the old learner walked zone 1's shot from 3 % to 1 % one step a day (30-second
shots every 96 seconds) and ratcheted zone 3's targets to 74.5 in four days. A band anchored on the operator's
value can't ratchet, the floor stops machine-gun shots, the operator's own edits move the band (jev_bridge), and a
rescue shot after a change puts the old value back and pauses the zone for two days. Nothing moves unless the
room's Auto setpoints switch is on.
