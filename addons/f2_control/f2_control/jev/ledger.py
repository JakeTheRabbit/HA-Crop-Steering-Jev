"""Every verdict Jev acted on, what code did, and how it turned out.

Entries go to a JSON-lines file in /data (it survives restarts and Rebuilds, like state.json). An entry
that names an `outcome` check is revisited once its time comes; the check's result is written back. A
judge's evidence then carries its own track record ("last 3 hand-overs: VWC held 3 of 3"), and a judge
can refuse to repeat a move that didn't work.
