"""Batch-tank dosing for every room, on one thread of its own (docs/DOSING.md).

The integration keeps each room's dosing setup and its one request, and publishes them as
sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>dosing_config. This thread reads that every 2 s and takes each request
once. A dose sets a pump's volume number and presses its start: the pump's own firmware runs the
motor for that volume and switches it off. A batch holds the watering it could disturb, fills the
tank, mixes it, doses the recipe in order and stamps the fill. Nothing here ever switches a dosing
motor on; switching one off (a stop, a dose past its time) is the only thing done to its power.
What each room is doing is published as sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>dosing.

Whatever could be left running is written to dosing_state.json before anything moves. Whatever
does not read off when a dose or a batch ends, and whatever a start finds recorded, holds its rooms'
watering and is switched off again on every pass until all of it reads off (_release_stuck). The
irrigation loop asks holds() before every shot. A batch sets its hold under the lock a shot starts
under (Controller._shot_lock): a shot either started before it, and the batch waits for that shot to
end, or never starts. Every switch-on goes through _on, which the way out (exit) never overtakes.
