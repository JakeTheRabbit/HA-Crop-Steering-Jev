"""The zone's setpoints follow its own highest readings, in a real Home Assistant, with the real controller.

6 Oct 2026, the owner: the P1 target is the highest VWC of the grow-day before, field capacity rises as the sensor
does, and the re-water threshold and the rescue floor move with field capacity, within each number's own min and max.
No 2-points-a-day limit, and nothing is written until a lights-on has kept a day before. Jev's
Setpoints judge keeps its P2 shot size (and centres its range on the moved threshold); the learner writes neither
the P1 target nor field capacity.

It starts from a seeded old install (tests_ha/fixtures/entry_3_8_learned_tent.json): the state file controller 3.8.0
wrote, with none of the new keys. Every number the controller writes is replayed into the real entity, so it must be
one Home Assistant accepts, under the id the integration registered.
