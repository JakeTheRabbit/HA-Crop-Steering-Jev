# Dryback planner and Jev line steering: delivery roadmap

**Spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-dryback-planner-jev-steering-design.md](../specs/2026-10-02-dryback-planner-jev-steering-design.md), approved by the owner on 2 Oct 2026, including the amendment that Jev is used maximally.

The spec is delivered as seven steps. Steps 1 and 2 have full implementation plans (below). Each later plan is written once the plan before it has merged into `testing`, against the code as it then is: every later plan builds on names the earlier ones create, and on what their soak shows. This page fixes those names now, so the plans agree.

## Delivery

One change, one branch, one pull request, into `testing`. Classes and soaks follow [docs/RELEASING.md](../../RELEASING.md): a C3 candidate soaks 7 days on staging with every fault drill and a seeded upgrade fixture, and a candidate carries at most one C2 or C3 change.

| # | Plan | Class | Needs | What goes live |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Remember nights and plateaus](2026-10-02-dryback-01-remember-nights.md) | C3 (state file) | nothing | Every zone records its daily plateau and each night's landing. The activity feed shows the morning record. No watering decision changes. |
| 2 | [Jev availability](2026-10-02-dryback-02-jev-availability.md) | C3 (add-on options) | nothing | Both routes to Jev (TypeSafe, then Cloudflare), retries, stale questions dropped, re-asks when Jev is unsure, the stricter gate after a bad run, a 5000-call budget with a push at 80 %. Applies to today's judges. |
| 3 | P1 plateau | C3 | 1, 2 | Engine input `plateau_reached`; `plateau.py`; the per-zone `line_steering` switch and the `p1_max_minutes` and `plateau_ceiling` numbers; the Steer judge's P1 variant sizes and spaces the ramp shots and calls the plateau. Switched zones only. |
| 4a | The line, Steer, the P2 end and the night | C3 | 1, 2, 3 | `line.py`, `tracker.py`, `p2_end.py`, `night.py`; engine inputs `p2_end_at`, `final_shot_pct`, `night_correction_pct` and the machine-gun guard; the Steer judge's day, P2-end and night variants; Dawn, Ramp, Salt, Dusk and Night not asked on switched zones; Setpoints retired there; each zone publishes its line, P2-end plan, last landing, clean-night streak and Jev's score. |
| 4b | Dashboard: the line and the previous run | C1 | 4a | The line layer and a P2-end marker on the day chart, using the layer toggles from #29, and Jev's calls on the Jev layer. **The previous run stays on the chart:** yesterday's actual VWC and pore EC, with yesterday's line and where it landed, drawn on the same clock as the compare layer (#28 draws it even when the room was off), so each day reads against the last. |
| 5 | Jev's daily and weekly jobs | C3 | 4a | The `plan`, `report` and `review` judges, and a stage proposal on the Stage judge. |
| 6 | F2 zone order | operations | 4a | Zone 1 first, then zone 3; zone 2 once the Probe judge trusts its probe. Switch flips, no code. |
| 7 | Room conditions (stage 2) | C3 | 4a | The environment entities in the room descriptor, the deliberate change to the guard in `tests/test_translations.py:141-158`, and Jev's ±20 % night-rate scale. |

Plans 1 and 2 are independent. Plan 1 goes first: it changes no decision, and every day it soaks is a recorded night that plan 4a's P2-end menu reads.

## Shared names

### State, from plan 1 (per zone in `/data/state.json`)

- `plateau_hist`: a list, newest last, at most 14 entries: `{"date", "value", "how", "shots"}`. `date` is the grow day (ISO), `value` the VWC P1 reached (the zone's `peak` when P1 handed over to P2), `how` what ended P1 (the engine's reason, "Jev's ramp judge: ...", or "set by hand"). Plan 3 adds `"rule"` and `"ec_turned"`; old entries lack them, so readers use `.get()`.
- `night_hist`: a list, newest last, at most 14 entries: `{"date", "plateau", "off_at", "off_vwc", "on_at", "on_vwc", "first_at", "landing", "night_rate", "p0_drop", "dryback_pct", "night_shots"}`. `date` is the grow day of the morning; `landing` the VWC just before the day's first shot (Athena p.39); `night_rate` points an hour from lights-off to lights-on, or to the first shot before lights-on; `night_shots` every shot between lights-off and the first shot. Unknown numbers are `null`. Plan 4a adds `"target"`, `"clean"` and `"net_fired"`.
- `night`: the night being measured, or `null`.
- `addons/f2_control/f2_control/zone_history.py`: `KEEP`, `fresh()`, `restore(saved)`, `plateau(st, *, day, value, how, shots)`, `phase_changed(st, was, new, *, day, how)`, `lights_off(st, vwc, now, day)`, `lights_on(st, vwc, now)`, `shot(st, *, vwc_before, now, day, first)`, `night_words(record)`.
- `Controller._record_phase(room, zone, st, was, new, now, how)`: called wherever P1 can hand over to P2 (the engine, a Jev judge's `advance`, the operator's Set Phase). The dead-probe time transitions only ever move to P3 or P0.

The spec's state list also names a "bench-until" field. The 2 Oct amendment removed the bench (Jev keeps steering on the stricter gate), and plan 2 reads the gate from the ledger, so there is no such field.

### Jev runtime, from plan 2

- `jev/client.py`: `NO_REQUESTS`, `NOT_JSON`, `NO_ANSWERS`; `retryable(error)`; `Route(name, fn, account, token, gateway=None)`; `Routes(routes, tries=3, window_s=60.0, sleep=time.sleep, clock=time.monotonic)`, a transport whose usage carries `route`, `failover` and `retries`; `Asker(..., daily_budget=5000, warn_pct=80, max_wait_s=300.0)` with `note(stat)` and `take_warning()`, and daily stats `retries`, `failovers`, `reasks` and `warned` (plus `route`, the last route that answered).
- `jev/ledger.py`: `Ledger.strict(judge, room, zone, after=3, clear=2)`.
- `jev/brain.py`: `Brain(..., reask_max=2, unsure_below=0.7, strict_after=3, strict_prob=0.8)`; `JudgeState.reask_due` and `JudgeState.reasks`; `Brain.events`, a list of `("strict", room, zone, judge)`; `Brain.strict`, `{(room, zone, judge): bool}`.
- `jev/judges/base.py`: `Judge.more_evidence(ctx, verdicts)`. Plan 4a's Steer judge overrides it with the last 3 days, the sibling zones and the doctrine excerpt.
- `jev_bridge.build()` stores `brain.routes`, the route names in the order they are tried.
- Add-on options: `jev_daily_calls` (default 5000), `jev_budget_warn_pct` (80), `jev_retries` (3), `jev_reask_max` (2), `jev_unsure_below` (0.7), `jev_strict_after` (3), `jev_strict_prob` (0.8).
- Error codes: CS-706 (Jev has used most of today's calls) and CS-707 (Jev is on the stricter gate for a zone), both in the `jev` notification kind. Later plans number from CS-708.

### Engine and integration, from plans 3 and 4a

- Every new engine input is neutral by default, and a golden test proves that with every one at its default each decision equals today's.
  - Plan 3: `ZoneSnapshot.plateau_reached: bool = False`.
  - Plan 4a: the P2 end (`p2_end_at` and `final_shot_pct`), `night_correction_pct`, and the machine-gun guard (a minimum gap and an hourly cap on `ZoneParams`, with a `shots_last_hour` snapshot field). Plan 4a fixes their types against `core.py` as it then is.
  - Each new `Reason` kind (plan 3: `p1_plateau`; plan 4a: `p2_final` and `p3_correction`) is added to `CAP_EXEMPT` (`core.py:38`), and the agreed exempt set pinned in `crop-steering-engine/tests/test_day_structure.py:45-47` is changed on purpose in the same commit.
- Integration (plan 3): `switch.crop_steering_{prefix}zone_{n}_line_steering` (off by default), `number.crop_steering_{prefix}zone_{n}_p1_max_minutes` (150) and `number.crop_steering_{prefix}zone_{n}_plateau_ceiling` (90), each with a `tests_ha/` test.
- Jev judges: `steer` (plan 3: the P1 variant; plan 4a: the day, P2-end and night variants), and `plan`, `report` and `review` (plan 5).

## Live checks per step

- **Plan 1:** the morning after it is installed, the activity feed shows a line "Zn night: landed ..." for each zone, and the add-on log shows each zone's plateau when its ramp hands over.
- **Plan 2:** `sensor.crop_steering_jev` shows `routes`, `retries_today`, `failovers_today`, `reasks_today`, `daily_budget` and `strict`. F2's options keep `jev_daily_calls: 2000` until the owner raises it to 5000 in the app's options, and the Cloudflare route exists only once `cf_account_id` and `cf_api_token` are set there (F2 runs on the TypeSafe key alone today).
